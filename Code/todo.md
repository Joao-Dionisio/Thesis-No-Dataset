## todo:
    1. instances: create non-smooth
    2. kernel selection:
       - manually (eg, according to instance's characteristics)
       - if we have time, choose with hyperopt (choice optimized per instance)
    3. computational experiment:
       - complement previous with new instances (firstly, with manual parameterization)
       - if time allows, add version with automatic parameterization (e.g. hyperopt)
    4. update paper
